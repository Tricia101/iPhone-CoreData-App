# iPhone-CoreData-App
First of all, I create a new swift project and make it use core data. I also create an entity named people and add some attributes in it. isFavorited is a special one and its type is Boolean. I generate the model class for the Entity and create NSManagedObject subclass. In the tableViewController, I Specify the fetch attributes and make FetchedResultsController. A fetched results controlled frc created in viewDidLoad. They do not only have data from xml file. They also has a var: isFavorited. If switch is on, this var is true. This person can be in favourite album. frc is then used to define the table.I add up an ImageView to the detail view controller and create an outlet for the new ImageView view. I have a method saveImage to get the path to Documents and a method loadImage to place the image to the ImageView. 
AddPersonViewController update an existing personâ€™s data and save a new person. And the person information will move to the tableViewController. This is all because of Two segues. SegueO is from add button to add a new person. Segue1 is from the table cell to update an item. We have both outlet and action usage for the favourite button. When it is action, it will show favourites album. When it is outlet, it can tell fetch to request.
SearchBar function also consider about searching in the favourite album. If name contains the searched string, the table will be reload.
